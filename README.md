| What are some high-value and high-touch use cases that you've seen for wide adoption of Power Apps within an organization?  | There have been many great customer stories published at [Microsoft Power Platform Stories Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-platform-stories/). EY has had several public use cases, one for finance at [eyzilla](https://aka.ms/eyzilla) and another where they created a solution that handled billions of dollars in PPP loan applications. |
| Low-code doesn't mean no-code, so where and how can code be used in this system? | Developers can incorporate code into many places in the platform - they can write custom UI components using common frameworks like Angular or React, and they can add .NET code to serve as event handlers or process complex logic via custom APIs or plugins.|
| Are the created apps centrally hosted by Microsoft Servers, or can they be deployed to a specified web host? | Power Apps are SaaS applications, and so they exist fully in the Microsoft cloud.  However, these apps can be built to run offline on a Windows, iOS, or Android device. |
|What is the pricing plan? Is it per user? Per created application? Both? | Power Apps has both user-based licensing as well as pay-as-you-go based on consumption. More details can be found on [Pricing - Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) |
| What would be examples where you would NOT use Power Apps? Where it is not suitable, for instance? | Power Apps don't cover every customer scenario, for instance if you want a native mobile app used by end customers, it wouldn't normally be a good fit.  That said, customers frequently compose solutions with a combination of low-code and pro-code, so it's not always a yes or no answer.|
|What sort of best practices do you see emerging for executing on devops, quality assurance and validation in a Fusion Development environment?| We've published a fusion development e-book here: [Ebook: Fusion development approach to building apps using Power Apps - Power Apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/)|
